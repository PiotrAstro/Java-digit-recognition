# Java digit recognition
 Fully self written neural network for digit recognition in Java in order to understand basics of neural network and see how it actually work

 My first ever Neural Network implementation. It support only Multilayer Perceptron.
 If you wouldlike to see something better look at: https://github.com/PiotrAstro/Java-Digit-Recognition-Convolutional-Network

 This new version is more generic, has convolutional NN ans more optimisers.
